I have developed a fully functional e-commerce application with the following features:</br>

## Product Page:

#### Implemented pagination for easy navigation through a large number of products.</br>
#### Users can add products to their cart with a single click.</br>
#### Implemented functionality to delete products from the inventory.</br>
#### Users can edit product details such as name, price, and image.</br>

## Cart Page
#### Users can view all the products they've added to their cart.</br>
#### Implemented quantity management: users can adjust the quantity of each product directly from the cart page.</br>
#### Automatically calculates the total amount based on the quantity and price of each product.</br>

## Technologies Used:
#### Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for the user interface.</br>
####  Backend: Node.js with Express.js for building RESTful APIs.</br>
####  Database: MongoDB for storing product and cart data.</br>
####  Pagination: Implemented pagination on the product page for better user experience.</br>
####  Deployment: Deployed the application to a hosting platform for public access.</br>

Overall, the application provides a seamless shopping experience with intuitive navigation and robust functionality. Users can easily browse products, manage their cart, and make purchases hassle-free.</br>
